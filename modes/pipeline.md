# Mode: pipeline — URL Inbox (Second Brain)

Processes job URLs queued in `data/pipeline.md`. The user adds URLs whenever they want, then runs `/career-ops pipeline` to process them all.

## Workflow

1. **Read** `data/pipeline.md` → find `- [ ]` items under the "Pending" section
2. **For each pending URL**:
   a. Compute the next sequential `REPORT_NUM` (read `reports/`, take the highest number + 1)
   b. **Extract the JD** using Playwright (browser_navigate + browser_snapshot) → WebFetch → WebSearch
   c. If the URL is not accessible → mark as `- [!]` with a note and move on
   d. **Run the full auto-pipeline**: A-F evaluation → .md report → PDF (if score >= 3.0) → tracker
   e. **Move from "Pending" to "Processed"**: `- [x] #NNN | URL | Company | Role | Score/5 | PDF ✅/❌`
3. **If there are 3+ pending URLs**, spawn agents in parallel (Agent tool with `run_in_background`) to maximize throughput.
4. **When finished**, show a summary table:

```
| # | Company | Role | Score | PDF | Recommended action |
```

## Pending

- [!] https://private.url/job — Error: login required

## Processed
- [x] #143 | https://jobs.example.com/posting/789 | Acme Corp | AI PM | 4.2/5 | PDF ✅

```

## Smart JD detection from URL

1. **Playwright (preferred):** `browser_navigate` + `browser_snapshot`. Works with any SPA.
2. **WebFetch (fallback):** For static pages or when Playwright isn't available.
3. **WebSearch (last resort):** Search secondary portals that index the JD.

**Special cases:**
- **LinkedIn**: May require login → mark `[!]` and ask the user to paste the text
- **PDF**: If the URL points to a PDF, read it directly with the Read tool
- **`local:` prefix**: Read the local file. Example: `local:jds/linkedin-pm-ai.md` → read `jds/linkedin-pm-ai.md`

## Automatic numbering

1. List every file in `reports/`
2. Extract the number from the prefix (e.g., `142-medispend...` → 142)
3. New number = highest found + 1

## Source sync

Before processing any URL, verify sync:
```bash
node cv-sync-check.mjs
```
If things are out of sync, warn the user before continuing.
